I wanna be home
Where is just home
Where moons surround me alone
And i follow my own

Saturn is the way
I met saturn on my way
Jupiter waves me obey
Mars couldn't be bothered

And i have a break on venus
Where i meet my mirror
And she smiles at me
And i wave her hello
And suddenly i see
Him as well
But he looks kind of different
His hair is short
And he reminds me
Of myself

And i follow my dreams
And i pick up well
Remember the lives
Which never tell

I wanna go home
Where i'll just be alone
With my own

(And an old friend comes along
His name is neptune
Moon is coming as well
And whispers little things in my ears
And afterwards i try to draw
What it means
Sometimes i need a translater)

Sometimes i have a bath in the sun
Where it's not too cold
Sometimes i dance in with saturn
And we hold my dream

Life is like a ping-pong
Ping-pong
And i jump in-between
Now i sit in my satellite
And i'm delighted
